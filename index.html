                                Finding the best funding sources for your small business depends upon many factors.  The key 
                                to determining the right capital for your small business is which stage of growth your 
                                business is in.  As you move from start up to growth stage, your small business financing needs 
                                and the funding sources available to you change.  Excelsior Growth Fund calls this “moving up the 
                                capital continuum.”  Read more to determine the best options for funding your small business.

                                In the startup stage of a small business, your capital will most likely come from equity sources.
                                  Equity should be viewed as a long-term investment in your company that does not bear interest and 
                                  generally does not have a specified repayment schedule. Generally speaking, equity funds have little 
                                  or no restrictions on what they can be used for.  Equity sources include:

                                Once your business is established, you will undoubtedly need capital to grow revenues, or to expand to a second 
                                location or even make an acquisition. However, you may not be eligible for a traditional bank loan because you do 
                                not have a track record, or maybe you are in a high-risk business such as a restaurant. The good news is that there 
                                are a large number of non-bank (“alternative”) lenders willing to provide you with capital. The bad news is that 
                                not all of these alternative lenders have your best interest in mind!<br><br>
								Alternative lending companies offer loans for early stage small businesses in need of quick access to capital. These 
                                lenders rely on your incoming revenues, debit/credit card receipts and/or the collection of	receivables for the repayment 
                                of their loan.  They are not subject to banking regulation and so can charge extremely high interest rates and fees and 
                                do not follow the same disclosure rules to consumers. Sources of alternative loan products include:

                                We encourage you uncover the true cost of different loan types by calculating the annual percentage rate (APR) for 
                                each option. This will give you an apples-to-apples comparison of your options. We invite you to check out related

                                might be surprised to learn of the “true” cost of different small business loans!

                                Another alternative community lending source are Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lenders. This group consists of 
                                traditional commercial banks, non-depository banks and CDFIs.  These lenders can offer commercial loans to higher risk 
                                small businesses because the SBA provides a guaranty in case the borrower cannot repay the loan. SBA loans can be used 
                                by small businesses that are just starting out because the lenders will look at projections as well as actual financial 
                                results.  In addition to microloans and Community Advantage loans, other types of SBA loans include:
